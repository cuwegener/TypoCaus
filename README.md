# TypoCaus
Typological database of causative constructions

These data has been collected by Natalia Levshina (Leipzig University) in 2013-2018.

The file typocaus_main.txt contains the data in the tab-separated format. Each row corresponds to one causative construction or pattern in a language. The columns represent the ID of the construction, information about the language, description of the form, meaning, productivity, formal type (lexical, morphological or syntactic, and Haiman's 1983 types), as well as examples, their glosses and translations and references. For some languages there is also historical information about the origin of the constructions, as well as some notes about the marking of the core participants of the causative situation and other details.  

The file typocaus_references.txt contains the bibliographical entries (reference grammars and research articles).

The total size of the database exceeds 100 languages. I'm in the process of converting the data from a different format and uploading it language by language. Please feel free to contact me if you need the data urgently.
