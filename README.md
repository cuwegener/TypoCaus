# TypoCaus
Typological database of causative constructions

The data has been collected by Natalia Levshina (Catholic University of Louvain & F.R.S.-FNRS and later Leipzig University) since 2013.

The file typocaus_main.txt contains the data in the tab-separated format. Each row corresponds to a specific causative pattern in a language. The columns represent the ID of the construction, genealogical and geographical information about the language, description of the form, meaning, productivity, formal type (lexical, morphological or syntactic, and Haiman's 1983 types). The database also contains examples, their glosses and translations. For some contructions I could also find information about their origin, as well as about the marking of the core participants of the causative situation and other details.  

The file typocaus_main_semantics.txt contains the same information, plus coding of the constructions for several semantic features (partly based on the examples!)

The file typocaus_references.txt contains the bibliographical entries (reference grammars and research articles).

The directory ShinyApp also contains the R code for the Shiny app, where one can currently search the causative constructions by language and create three types of semantic maps. To run the application, install R, RStudio and run the application from the console (button 'Run App').

The total size of the database exceeds 100 languages. I'm in the process of converting the data from a different format and uploading it language by language. Please feel free to contact me if you need the data urgently.
